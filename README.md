Former IT Manager for a Norwegian based firm, I moved to London to attend Europe's leading Web Developer bootcamp "Makers Academy" and now looking for a Full Stack Developer role.

## About
When describing my self I like to use the latin word "Omnia" which translates to "everything".
I am that guy that you know you can contact if you need anything fixed or built.

My insatiable curiosity to know how things work coupled with fast learning skills always led me to embark in new and exciting challenges.
Starting an hardware recycling company, becoming an on-site hardware Tech responsible for several international companies, studying aircraft engineering, and building stages for concerts around Europe.
My motto was always "if a human being did that, I can do it too".

And then, 2 years ago, with no previous coding experience I taught myself Python in a couple of months and build an integration module between my current company logistic software and a 3rd party sales portal. This got me hooked on coding.

I continued my journey by completing several MOOC in computer science, and finally decided to put my "everything" into becoming a Full Stack Developer.
