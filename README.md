## Daniele Lixi

former IT Manager for a Norwegian based firm, moved to London to attend Europe's leading Web Developer bootcamp "Makers Academy" and looking for a Full Stack Junior Developer role. When describing my self I like to use the latin word "omnia" which translate to "everything". I'am that guy that you know you can contact if you need anything fixed or built. My insatiable curiosity to know how things works couple with fast learning skills as always led me to embark in new and exciting challenges.
Like starting an hardware recycling company in collaboration with my hometown Turin, becoming an onsite hardware Tech responsible for several international companies, studying aircrafts engineering, building stages for concerts around Europe, my motto was always "if a human did that I can do it too". And then 2 years ago, with no previous coding experience I taught myself Python in a couple of months and build an integration module between my current company logistic software and a 3rd party sales portal. This got me hooked on coding and I continued my journey by completing severals MOOC in computer science, and finally decided to put my everything into becoming a Full Stack Developer.
